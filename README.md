# Underwater Camera

Underwater Camera is a Valheim mod using [Harmony](https://harmony.pardeike.net/) and [BepinEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/) and aimed at improving the creative mode building experience by allowing you to see what you're doing when building underwater, but you can also use it to peek at the fishes!

## Settings
Start up the game with the mod installed to generate the config file in BepInEx/config, or use BepInEx Configuration Manager to configure.
